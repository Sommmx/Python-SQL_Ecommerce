# 🛒 E-commerce Business Analysis using Python + SQL

## 📊 Real-World Problem Solving with Data

In the fast-growing world of e-commerce, understanding **customer behavior**, **product performance**, and **payment patterns** is crucial for strategic decisions. This project simulates the role of a **Data Analyst in an e-commerce company** who is asked to uncover actionable insights from raw operational data.

We use a blend of **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** and **SQL (MySql)** to clean, explore, and analyze a real-world e-commerce dataset from Brazil.

## 🔍 Business Context

> Imagine you're working for a mid-sized e-commerce company. Management wants to answer key business questions:
>
> - Who are our most valuable customers?
> - Which product categories are driving revenue?
> - Are we delivering orders on time?
> - What trends are emerging in customer payments and reviews?

This project answers these questions with **data-backed insights** and translates them into **strategic recommendations**.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **SQL**: SQLite (via `MySql`)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Source**: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv)

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Loaded 9 CSV files (customers, orders, payments, reviews, etc.)
- Handled missing values & dropped duplicates
- Renamed inconsistent columns
- Merged datasets into a unified view

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed order status, delivery delays, review scores
- Visualized:
  - Revenue by Year
  - Top Product Categories
  - Review Sentiments
  - Delay between Estimated vs Actual Delivery

### 3. 🗄 SQL-Based Analysis (via SQLite)
- Loaded cleaned data into a SQLite database
- Wrote advanced SQL queries to find:
  - Most valuable customers (LTV)
  - Repeat vs one-time buyers
  - Best-performing states & product categories
  - Payment trends over time

## 💡 Key Business Insights

- 📈 **Revenue is increasing year-over-year**, indicating healthy growth.
- 🚚 **Delivery delays correlate with lower review scores**, affecting brand trust.
- 🛍️ **A few product categories dominate sales**, suggesting marketing focus areas.
- 💳 **Credit card is the most used payment method**, followed by boleto (bank slip).
- 🌎 **Customers from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro** generate the most revenue.
- 🧾 **Majority of customers are one-time buyers** — retention efforts needed.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add Machine Learning for **review sentiment analysis**
- Create **interactive dashboards** using Power BI or Streamlit
- Deploy SQL queries in **PostgreSQL** for production-like simulation
